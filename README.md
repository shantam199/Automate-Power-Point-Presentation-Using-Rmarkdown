# Automate-Power-Point-Presentation-Using-Rmarkdown
I have tried automating the power point presentation using Rmarkdown. so if you have fixed steps where you extract data and clean and then visualize then you can try automating that process using r markdown.

RMD file contains the code and the template.pptx is the template file.if you have any other template then you can change that with this file.

and the simple_slides.pptx is the final output.
